\begin{abstract}
  We obtain exact results for the kinetics of the inertial motion of 
two hard discs in a rectangular two-dimensional box.
We calculate the first encounter (first crash between the discs),
the first \emph{hopping time} and the mean times for these events.
  We define the  hopping time as the interval 
 between exchanges of the horizontal positions of the discs.

\section{Introduction}

Billiars are ubicuous models for
Hamiltonian Classical Mechanics. They have been used since times
of Galileo, but their usage skyrocketed after two great
discoveries: the Boltzman $\mathit{H}$ theorem and Sinai's Ergodic
Theorem.  A planar billiard produces, with very simple static elements
which take the place of potentials (the borders) and the most simple
dinamic element (the point particle) the hardest 
forms of rigourosly chaotic motion. 

Most of the work in chaotic behaviour present results that
are only aplicable on averege, or after long periods of time, that is,
after some termalization process has been noticeable. 
How these procesess begin
or how short time dynamics are affected by the chaotic propiertes
is largerly unknown. A remarkable exception to this
is the study of ``stickiness'' \cite{Altman} 
of integrable KAM islands and other
transient results. 
We must not neglect short time phenomena, as they can be essential
to the interpretations of our models. 

In this work we present a planar billiard, which could belong
to a \emph{two particle Boltzmann gas} class. The mean first
encounter of the particles could give us an insight in
reaction times of very diluted gases, and the hopping times
could be used as a random binary switch for a nanotechnolgy device.
It would be usseful to understand how the distributions for
such events are generated, and what their propiertes are.


\section{Model}

We consider two discs of radius $r$ (and diameter $d=2r$) 
in a box of width $w$ and height $h$ (figure\ref{billar01}). 
The discs move inertly in the absence of forces, 
following straight-line trajectories, 
and undergo elastic collisions with each other and with the walls of the box.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.56\textwidth]{DiscosenCajaCuadrada01.pdf}
  \caption{The Billiard}\label{billar01}
\end{figure}


We denote the position of the centre of the $i$th disc by 
$(x_{i}, y_{i})$ for $i=1,2$. 
Since the discs and walls are infinitelly hard, 
the disc centres are restricted to the region $(x_i, y_i) \in [-a,a] \times [-b, b]$, 
where $a \defeq a(d) \defeq \frac{w}{2} - r = \frac{w-d}{2}$ and 
$b \defeq b(d) \defeq \frac{h}{2} - r = \frac{h-d}{2}$.

The exclusion condition is $(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge (2r)^2 = d^2$.
It is thus useful to work in terms of the new coordinates
\begin{equation}\label{cambiocoor01}
 x \defeq \frac{x_1 - x_2}{\sqrt{2}}; 
\quad X \defeq \frac{x_1 + x_2}{\sqrt{2}}; 
\quad y \defeq \frac{y_1 - y_2}{\sqrt{2}}; 
\quad Y \defeq \frac{y_1 + y_2}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}

These coordinates are a $\pi/4$ rotation of the $x_i$, and  $y_i$ planes in the
full configuration space. They are isometric.

In these coordinates, we have the conditions 
$x \in [-a \sqrt{2}, +a \sqrt{2}]$ with $X \in [-a \sqrt{2} + |x|, a \sqrt{2} - |x|]$ 
and similarly $y \in [-b \sqrt{2}, b \sqrt{2}]$ and 
$Y \in [-b \sqrt{2} + |y|, +b \sqrt{2} - |y|]$,  
with the constraint $x^2 + y^2 \ge \frac{d^2}{2}$.

The border conditions define an hypercube with  sides of lengths $a,a,b,b$.
The exclusion defines a  hypercylindrical wall inside, placed
diagonally between two hyperaristas. Sections from this hypercilinder
orthogonal to the $X,Y$ axis produce circles with radius $\sqrt{2} r$
The dynamics in such a space
would be the usual billiard dynamics in a four dimensional table with
three dimensional borders. The rules for ellastic collitions
are exactly the same as for point particles 
in planar billiards with one dimensional
borders, namelly, the change of velocity after a collition would only
affect the normal component of the velocity, changing its sign. 


The fact that this kind of systems are equivalent to a Bernoulli flow,
and thus ergodic and mixing, have been fully established. For this kind
of systems we would expect a certain shape of decay distributions, namely, 
exponential. The time distribution for all the events that we are
interested should be of this sort.  


\section{Mean time between events}

A system of $N$ hard spheres confined by hard walls inside a $d$ dimensional
pace may be treated as a billiard system \cite{Sinai70, MarkChern}, 
in which a single point  
particle undergoes free motion between reflecting obstacles 
in a $ d N $-dimensional configuration space. 

If the resulting billiard is ergodic and hyperbolic, 
there exists 
a result for the mean free time, i.e. the mean time between 
collisions of the particle with the walls \cite{MarkChern}. 
This can be thought of as a mean return time to the $(d-1)$-dimensional 
(i.e. co-dimension-$1$) cross-section given by the wall boundaries.
If the particle in question has velocity scaled
to unity, this formula reads as follows:
\begin{equation}
 \mean{\tau} = \frac{|Q|}{|A|} \frac{|S^{d-1}|}{|B^{d-1}|},
\end{equation}
Here $|Q|$ denotes the $d$-dimensional volume of the available space in the 
billiard and 
$|A|$ the $(d-1)$-dimensional area of the cross-section.
 $|S^{d-1}|$ is the $(d-1)$-dimensional area of the unit sphere in $\RR^d$ given by
\begin{equation}
  |S^{d-1}| = \frac{2 \pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2)},
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the gamma function. 
$|B^{d-1}|$ is the volume of the unit ball 
in $\RR^{d-1}$, given by $|B^{d-1}| = |S^{d-2}| / (d-1)$.

Machta and Zwanzig \cite{MachtaZwan} used a similar method to derive an escape 
time across a non-existent boundary by treating it as a recurrence time.
Since it is an escape time, they used velocities whose components point only 
perpendicularly to the ``exit wall''. This
shows the flexibility of the formula: the area  $|A|$ can represent
any cross section in configuration space,
or, via the appropiate canonical transformation, any
cross section in any $d$ dimensional subspace
of the full phase space.
 
In our case, we are interested in the 
mean return time to a codimension-$1$ cross section.
The first of them is the ``hopping time'' 
which is delimited by the exact moment
in which the disks interchange their horizontal position. 
Algebraically, this can be stated either as
$x_1 = x_2$ or $x=0$.
This surface is accessible from \emph{both} sides, 
so that there is an extra factor of two in the part of the area 
$|A|$. Thus 
we rewrite the mean time taking this into account: 
\begin{equation}
 \mean{\tau} = \frac{|Q| \, |S^{d-1}|} {2 \, |A| \, |B^{d-1}|}.	
\end{equation}
The second cross section represents the collition
event, that is, when $x^2+y^2=2r^2$. This has only one
side accesible to the four dimensional
equivalent particle in full configuration space,
so no extra factor appears anywhere.

For more general values of $E$ and $m$, 
we are simply working on a different energy surface in phase space. 
The particle trajectories are identical but their motion is a factor
$\sqrt{2E/m}$ faster, so that all times are reduced by this factor.
That should be taken into account when setting a numerical value
for either the total energy or the magnitude of the initial momenta.
For simplicity, we have used disks with equal mass, which numerically
will be set to one. We devote the next section
to obtain the exact values of $|Q|$ and $|A|$.


\section{Calculation of Volumes and Areas}

We proceed to calculate the Area and Volume quantities. 
From the change of coordinates,
we have a relative uncomfortable geometry to work upon. The configuration
space is an hypercube with an hyper-cylinder substracted in a diagonal position.
The uncomfortable part is to deal with the tips of the cylinder, which
present the  shape of a wedge with a circular base and two 
orthogonal ``heights''. It may be done in an indirect manner.


\subsection{Volume of available space}


We shall present the total four-dimensional volume as a product integral
of all available positions. To better grasp the idea, a convenient
diagram is shown in the next figure, \ref{diagintegra01}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{diagramintegra01.pdf}
  \caption{The space to integrate is the product of the subspaces
    belonging to horizontal and vertical coordinates. The colour
    shaded area represents the ``exclusion'' set, where the condition 
    $ (x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge d^2 $ is not fulfilled. 
    Their width is dependent on the particular point of evaluation
    on the \emph{other} subspace. The diagonal coordinates
    make the expression to evaluate simpler. Due to 
    symmetry, we only evaluate the area in stripes and
    multiply by 16.}\label{diagintegra01}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
 V = \int_{x_1 = -a}^a \rd x_1 \int_{x_2 = -a}^a \rd x_2 
\int_{y_1 = -b}^b \rd y_1 \int_{y_2 = -b}^b \rd y_2 \, \indicator{ (x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge d^2 },
\end{equation}
where $\indicator{Z}$ indicates the indicator function of the set $Z$, given by $\mathbf{1}_Z (x) = 1$ if $x \in Z$, and $=0$ if $x \notin Z$, which restricts the integral to the desired region $Z$.

We represent the excluded cylinder in the coordinates defined in 
the set of equation \ref{cambiocoor01}. 

\begin{equation}
 V = \int_{x=-a \sqrt{2}}^{a \sqrt{2}} \rd x 
\int_{X=-a \sqrt{2} + |x| }^{a \sqrt{2} - |x|}  \rd X
 \int_{y=-b \sqrt{2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\int_{Y=-b \sqrt{2} + |y| }^{b \sqrt{2}-|y|}  \rd Y
\, \indicator{ x^2 + y^2 \ge \frac{d^2}{2}  }.
\end{equation}
In these coordinates, $X$ and $Y$ do not appear 
in the integrand, so that these integrals may be done trivially, 
thus reducing to the following two-dimensional integral:
\begin{align}
 V &= \int_{x=-a \sqrt{2}}^{a \sqrt{2}} \rd x  
\int_{y=-b \sqrt{2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\, 2 \left( a \sqrt{2} - |x| \right) \, 2 \left( b \sqrt{2} - |y| \right) \,  
\indicator{ x^2 + y^2 \ge \frac{d^2}{2} } \\
&= 16 \int_{x=0}^{a \sqrt{2}} \rd x  \int_{y=0}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\, \left( a \sqrt{2} - x \right) \, \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right) \,  
\indicator{ x^2 + y^2 \ge \frac{d^2}{2} },
\end{align}
using the symmetry.

Thus $V = 16(I_1 + I_2)$, 
where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the resulting integrals over the regions 
where the available region for $y$ is affected by, and is not affected by, 
respectively, the restriction to lie outside the disc.
We have
\begin{align}
 I_1 &= \int_{x=0}^{d / \sqrt{2}} \left[ \int_{y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} {d^2} - x^2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right) \rd y \right]  \left( a \sqrt{2} - x \right) \rd x \\
&= 	
a b^{2} d + \textstyle \frac{1}{6} (a+b) d^{3} - \frac{1}{32}  d^{4} - \frac{1}{4} {\left(\pi a b + b^{2}\right)} d^{2},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
 I_2 &= \int_{x=d / \sqrt{2}}^{a \sqrt{2}} \left[ \int_{y = 0}^{b \sqrt{2}} \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right) \rd y \right]  \left( a \sqrt{2} - x \right) \rd x \\
&=	
{\left( a^{2} - a d + \textstyle \frac{1}{4}  d^{2}\right)} b^{2}.
\end{align}
Thus 
\begin{equation}\label{volumeabd}
 V %= 16(I_1 + I_2) =     	
= 16 a^{2} b^{2}  - 4 \pi a b d^{2} + \textstyle \frac{8}{3} (a+b) d^{3}  - \frac{1}{2} d^{4},
\end{equation}
as was previously obtained by Munakata and Hu \cite{Munakata02}.

Note the volume available to place two discs inside the hard box but \emph{without} the 
 hard-disc exclusion constraint is simply given by the first term, $16 a^2 b^2$; thus, the remaining terms represent the excluded volume due to this constraint.

We have checked this result with simple Monte Carlo simulations, by generating random positions for the sphere centres in $[-a,a] \times [-b,b]$ uniformly and 
counting the proportion of such initial conditions for which the two spheres do not overlap.

\subsection{Volume of cross-section $\{x_1 = x_2\}$}
The calculation of the $3$-dimensional volume of the cross-section $\{x_1 = x_2\}$, which becomes 
$\{ x=0 \}$ in the new coordinates, proceeds in a similar way:

\begin{align}
 A &= \int_{X=-a \sqrt{2} }^{a \sqrt{2}}  \rd X
 \int_{y=-b \sqrt{2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\int_{Y=-b \sqrt{2} + |y| }^{b \sqrt{2}-|y|}  \rd Y
\, \indicator{y^2 \ge \frac{d^2}{2} } \\
&= 8 a \sqrt{2} \int_{y=0}^{b \sqrt{2}} \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right)  \indicator{y \ge \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}}  \rd y \\
&= 8 a \sqrt{2} \int_{y= \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}}^{b \sqrt{2}}  \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right)  \rd y \\
&= 2 \sqrt{2} a ( 2b - d )^2.
% b^{2} -  b d + \frac{d^{2}}{4} \right) .
\end{align}

We have checked this result with simple Monte Carlo simulations, by counting the proportion of successful placements of hard discs for which the distance $|x_1 - x_2|$ is within a small tolerance of $0$.


\subsubsection{I do not know if all this is worth it\ldot}
For comparition, we shall use also other area to compare
some propierties of the decay of time distributions. The most natural and simple
time would be the mean time between any two collitions. This corresponds
to the adecuate measure of the border of the four dimensional
billiard in which the dynamics takes place. There is a nice trick
to obtain this Area once that we know the Volume formula. The Area
can be thought of an infinitesimal volume element, so we have to put
all the volume from the measures as function of a single parameter
and derivate with respect to it. 
There are some care that we must take into account:
Every ``face'' has to be taken twice, as  

When dealing with figures
which are not topologically spheres, this trick requires
a grain of salt. The parameter has to take different
signs for the \emph{negative} volume elements. A geometrical
intuitive grasp can be obtained by appling the trick to an annulus:
To get the border measure, we increase the outher circle and
decrease the inner one. The infinitesimal difference between the two
is the perimeter. 


 We start with formula \ref{volumeabd}
and substitute the auxiliary symbols $a,$ for their expression in
terms of $w,h$.
\begin{equation}\label{volumehwd}
 V= (w-d)^2(h-d)^2-\pi(w-d)(h-d)d^2+\frac{4}{3}(h+w-2d)d^3-\frac{1}{2}d^4
\end{equation}
The first term is simply the rectangular hyperprism, the variation in question
would be:

We make a slight variation on all the terms which  define the geometry,
making the substitutions
\begin{align}
w & \rightarrow w+\epsilon \\
h & \rightarrow h+\epsilon \\
d & \rightarrow d+\epsilon ,
\end{align}
resulting in
\begin{equation}\label{volumeepsilon}
 V(\epsilon) = (w-d)^2(h-d)^2-\pi(w-d)(h-d)(d+\epsilon)^2+
\frac{4}{3}(h+w-2d)(d+\epsilon)^3-\frac{1}{2}(d+\epsilon)^4.
\end{equation}

Then, taking the derivative at $\epsilon=0$, we obtain

\begin{equation}\label{Areaepsilon}
 \frac{dV}{d\epsilon} \vert_{\epsilon=0}
= d^2(w+h)(4+2\pi)-d^3
\end{equation}


\subsection{Mean hopping time}

In order to simplify things, we will use $E=1/2$ and $m_i=1$.
The system of two hard discs is equivalent to a billiard in $d=4$ dimensions, so that

\begin{equation}
 |S^{d-1}| = |S^3| = 2 \pi^2; \qquad |B^{d-1}| = 4 \pi / 3.
\end{equation}

Inserting these results into the formula for the mean hopping time gives
\begin{equation}
 \mean{\tau} = 	
\frac{3 \pi}{4}
\frac
{16 a^{2} b^{2}  - 4 \pi a b d^{2} + \textstyle \frac{8}{3} (a+b) d^{3}  - \frac{1}{2} d^{4}}
{ 2 \sqrt{2} a ( 2b - d )^2}.
\end{equation}

Substituting the expressions for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $w$, $h$ and $d$ gives
the main result of this paper, the exact expression for the mean hopping time:
\begin{equation}\label{hoptimegeneral}
 \mean{\tau} = \frac{3 \pi}{4 \sqrt{2}}
\frac{(w-d)^2(h-d)^2-\pi(w-d)(h-d)d^2+\frac{4}{3}(h+w-2d)d^3-\frac{1}{2}d^4}
{(w-d)(h-2d)^2}
\end{equation}

As one can directly perceive from the denominator in the last expression, the
time blows up quadratically as $d\rightarrow h/2$, which agrees
with heuristic arguments. 

We will use for comparison with numerics square boundaries, 
so that $h=w$. This simplifies a bit more the above 
formula:

\begin{equation}\label{hoptimesquare}
 \mean{\tau} =\frac{3\pi}{8\sqrt{2}} 
\frac{(h-d)^4-\pi(h-d)^2d^2+\frac{8}{3}(h-d)d^3-\frac{1}{2}d^4}
{(h-d)(h-2d)^2}
\end{equation}



\section{Lo que falta}

\emph{Comparison with numerics: is perfect!}

Well, more or less. There seems to be some issues about the convergence of the
data, but is to be expected. First, I show you my semi manual results of
the mean hopping time. I will put here some examples of the
distributions, as they show why the convergence occurs better for some
sizes than for others.

The next figure, \ref{MeanHopp01} shows the theoretical curve 
expressed in the formula \ref{hoptimesquare} and some points
that Karel obtained from numerical experiments. The most interesting
parts of the curve where sampled more, while the ``boring'' part
of the curve has just a pair of points. This flatter section of
the behaviour shows much better convergence, and I think a
good heuristic argument can be made for this.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.56\textwidth]{Mean_Hopping_Time_manual.png}
  \caption{The mean hopping time as function of the diameter, Energy, mass, and geometry fixed.
The red line is theoretical, the black dots are the numerical experiments, and the error bars
represent the standard deviation.}\label{MeanHopp01}
\end{figure}

From the figure we can see that the explosive regime falls a bit short of
the theoretical estimate, while  the flat regime has a slightly longer
time than expected. This has to do with the mixing and averaging scales
of the numerical experiments, and is a consequence of some
qualitative differences between small, medium and big disks. The numerics where done
by limiting the number of collisions, of all types, taking into account
that the average time between collisions is a good scale of time
for billiard systems. This sets a lower limit for collations between
disks in the smaller regime, as this became effectively very
improbable in the short term. This affects the ``short term ergodicity'' and
mixing rates of the system. For relative low sampling limits, the
smaller disks behave effectively as if each was alone in the box, thus
producing results which have some qualities of integrable systems. 

\begin{figure}[h]
        \centering

logarhytmic scales, here I take that liberty for the funny features to be
more exageratedly shown.}\label{histohopps}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{bigradious} shows clearly an exponential decay in the
distribution, something to be expected for a chaotic system \cite{OttLibro} , while the
figure in \ref{smallradious} is something different. 

To do: comparison of our mean hopping time with the mean *first* time to hop, which is what is studied in other papers.
Hopefully (and presumably) they are the same asymptotically when $\epsilon \to 0$?

For square box, can escape in either direction, so hopping time (including in other direction) should be half? Could be. The events are ``almost independent'', so each one
can occur first with probability one half. If the disks are very small, then
they are trully independent events, but if they are big, one event taking
place hinders the other, so probably we should not think that is 
one half. A carefull inspection for the $\|A\|$ element in formula \ref{hoptimegeneral}
should be the answer to that.


\textbf{ 3D?  Must be long channel. Spheres may be confined in 1 direction  and only able to exchange in other direction, or be able to exchange in two directions.
This probably affects asymptotics.}

Escape time through a hole in the wall?? (Probably leave for future.)
Mean time between disc collisions, collisions with walls. Should be easy with the formula

Distributions of all these times (numerical with histogram).
