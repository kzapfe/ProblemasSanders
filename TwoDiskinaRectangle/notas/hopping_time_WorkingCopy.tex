\begin{abstract}
  Mean First Event Times (MFET) play important roles in
Statistical Mechanics. They underlie at the bottom
of observable macroscopic quantities, such as transport and
reaction rates.  
Numeric simulations and heuristic arguments
have previously shown  that the MFET  follow 
simple rules dependant on geometric 
parameters.
 Using ergodic theory formulas for recurrence times we obtain exact 
results for Mean Event Times in a paradigmatic system: 
two hard discs in a rectangular two-dimensional box.
  In particular,  we calculate exactly the mean hopping time between exchanges
 of the horizontal positions of the discs, 
as well as mean collision rates between the two discs and 
 between the discs and the box. We compare this with numerical experiments and
against MFET  and show that they share the same
general behaviour.

\section{Introduction}

For the statistical physicist and theoretical
chemist, \emph{mean} and \emph{first} event
times are of uttermost importance, as many properties,
such as mixing, reaction and diffusion rates depend on it. 
Two events can model the fundamental occurrences of
these kind of problems. One is the \emph{hopping},
in which two particles interchange position along some
axis of interest, and the other
is the \emph{collision} of said particles. 
A highly simplified model which has been successfully  used for
this research consist in two disks inside a rectangular
box \cite{Awazu01, Munakata02, Suh05}.

Previous work
by Bowles \etal shows general quantitative results for the hopping 
mean time for inertial and Brownian dynamics \cite{Bowles04}. 
They use arguments derived from Transition State Theory 
to provide expressions for the
general behaviour of these quantities, as functions of the
radius of the disks. Their results show the adequate algebraic behaviour, 
and very interesting work has expanded from that line \cite{Suh05, Ball09}.
There is also a statistical thermodynamic treatment by Munakata \etal 
which deals very comprehensively with partition functions, pressure,
and temperatures \cite{Munakata02, Munakata06}. 
Our  primary intention is
to find  the first hopping and collision times of the two disks under 
inertial motion. We show that this can 
be obtained  as a closed analytic expression dependant only
on the geometric parameters of the system, which turns 
out to be a rational function whose limiting form
has the algebraic exponent predicted in the aforementioned literature. 

The exact treatment  turns to be  feasible because  
the reduced model is a hard sphere billiard. 
Such systems  are one of the most recurred models for
statistical physics and  traditionally, for non linear dynamics.  
Some of these simple models
 provide us with a deep mathematical understanding
about  the properties collectively called  \emph{Hard Chaos} 
(hyperbolicity, ergodicity and mixing qualities \cite{Sinai70, Gallavotti74}). 
One such system is the
gas of disks in a rectangular box \cite{SzaszBook00}, 
for which the simplest non trivial
realization is the case of only two disks inside the box, which
is exactly the model in question.
This billiard is chaotic in
strong sense \cite{Sim99}. The system  is thus amenable
to analytic treatment0
and rigorous results have been obtained from ergodic theory \cite{MarkChern}.

The previous  results on
inertial dynamics can be extended  by giving
exact expressions for the mean times. We shall  obtain them through application of 
Machta and Zwanzig formula for residence times \cite{MachtaZwan}. 
We shall also  compare \emph{mean event times} with \emph{mean first event times},
and give some arguments to explain the agreement between the two. 
Brownian dynamics shall be discussed elsewhere \cite{WorkInProgress}.



\section{Model}

We consider two discs of radius $r$ (and diameter $d=2r$) 
in a box of width $w$ and height $h$ (figure\ref{billar01}). 
The discs move inertially in the absence of forces, 
following straight line trajectories,
and undergo elastic collisions with each 
other and with the walls of the box.
We take the mass of each disk as unitary, so that the energy
is the value of the Hamiltonian function inside the billiard table:
\begin{equation}
H(q,p)=\frac{1}{2}(\|p_1\|^2+\|p_2\|^2)=1.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{DiscosenCajaCuadrada01.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The Billiard}\label{billar01}
\end{figure}

We denote the position of the centre of the $i$th disc by 
$(x_{i}, y_{i})$ for $i=1,2$. Since the discs are hard, 
the disc centres are restricted to the region 
$(x_i, y_i) \in [-a,a] \times [-b, b]$, where 
$a \defeq a(r) \defeq \frac{w}{2} - r = \frac{w-d}{2}$ and
 $b \defeq b(r) \defeq \frac{h}{2} - r = \frac{h-d}{2}$.


The exclusion condition is $(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge (2r)^2 = d^2$.
It is thus useful to work in terms of the new coordinates
\begin{equation}\label{cambiocoor01}
 x \defeq \frac{x_1 - x_2}{\sqrt{2}}; 
\quad X \defeq \frac{x_1 + x_2}{\sqrt{2}}; 
\quad y \defeq \frac{y_1 - y_2}{\sqrt{2}}; 
\quad Y \defeq \frac{y_1 + y_2}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}


In these coordinates the conditions are rewritten as
$x \in [-a \sqrt{2}, +a \sqrt{2}]$ with 
$X \in [-a \sqrt{2} + |x|, a \sqrt{2} - |x|]$, respectively 
 $y \in [-b \sqrt{2}, b \sqrt{2}]$ and $Y \in [-b \sqrt{2} + |y|, +b \sqrt{2} - |y|]$,  
with the constraint $x^2 + y^2 \ge 2 r^2$.

The constrains define a four dimensional
rectangular prism  and a four dimensional cylinder placed inside.
This cylinder has radius $r\sqrt{2}$ and lies
in  a diagonal position along the axes $X, Y$. 
The dynamics in such a space follow
the usual billiard rules: free flight until
encounter with a wall, then elastic reflection.
The outer borders are flat, so the
hyperbolicity is due to the inner dispersing
boundary \cite{Sim99}, which represents the collision of
two disks in the original space.


\section{Mean time between events}


\subsection{Assumptions for the Collision Rates}

A system of $N$ hard spheres confined by hard walls in a $D$ dimensional
space may be treated as a billiard system 
in which a single point  particle undergoes free motion between reflecting obstacles 
in a $ D N $-dimensional configuration space \cite{Sinai70, Sim99, MarkChern}. 
If the resulting billiard is ergodic and hyperbolic, then we know that
these systems are equivalent to Bernoulli Flows \cite{Gallavotti74}.
For such systems is expected an exponential decay of 
distributions \cite{AbadiGalves} with potentially
long algebraic tails \cite{ZasTip}. 
This includes recurrence times and
first encounter times. We also
have a result for the mean free time, i.e.\ the mean time between 
collisions of the particle with the walls \cite{MarkChern}. 
This can be thought of as a mean return time to the $(D-1)$-dimensional 
(i.e. co-dimension-$1$) cross-section given by the wall boundaries.
The general formula for that time is
\begin{equation}\label{meanfreetime}
 \mean{\tau} = \frac{|Q|}{|A|} \frac{|S^{D-1}|}{|B^{D-1}|}.
\end{equation}
Here $|Q|$ denotes the $D$-dimensional volume of the available 
space in the billiard and 
$|A|$ the $(D-1)$-dimensional area of the cross-section.
 $|S^{D-1}|$ is the $(D-1)$-dimensional area of the unit sphere in $\RR^D$ given by
\begin{equation}
  |S^{D-1}| = \frac{2 \pi^{D/2}}{\Gamma(D/2)},
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the gamma function. 
$|B^{D-1}|$ is the volume of the unit ball 
in $\RR^{D-1}$, given by $|B^{D-1}| = |S^{D-2}| / (D-1)$.
In the formula \ref{meanfreetime}  the particle has 
its velocity scaled to unity.

Machta and Zwanzig \cite{MachtaZwan} used a similar method to derive an escape 
time across a non-existent boundary by treating it as a recurrence time.
Since it is an escape time, they used velocities whose components point only 
perpendicularly to the ``exit wall''.

In our case, we are interested in the mean return time to 
a co-dimension-$1$ cross section, 
which is defined by the exact moment
in which the disk interchange their horizontal position. This is simply
\begin{equation} \label{condchoque}
x_1 = x_2.
\end{equation}

Given that each disk has different momentum, but
they can interchange it without affecting the
total energy, we must take into account the mass $m$ of each disk 
and the total kinetic energy $E$.
If both discs have the same mass then $\sum_i \vv_i^2 = 2E / m$.
The above result, as derived by Chernov, 
was for the case $\sum_i \vv_i^2 = 1$, or $m=1$ and $E=\frac{1}{2}$.  
For more general values of $E$ and $m$, 
we are simply working on a different energy surface in phase space. 
The particle trajectories are identical but the motion is a factor
$\sqrt{2E/m}$ faster. Then all times must divided by this value, 
giving for
the mean time between events the general formula:
\begin{equation} \label{meantimegeneral}
  \mean{\tau} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E / m}} 
\frac{|Q| \, |S^3|} {|A| \, |B^3|}.	
\end{equation}
In our particular case, the effective dimension is four,
and $E=m=1$, so that the general factor of the formula appear as:
\begin{equation} \label{meantimegeneralredux}
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2E / m}} 
\frac{|S^3|}{|B^3|}=\frac{3\pi}{2\sqrt{2}}.	 
\end{equation}

The next step is obtaining the Volume (4 dimensional measure) of
the available space and the Area (3 dimensional induced measure) of
the collision conditions. We devote the next section to
detail the procedure.


\section{Calculation of Volumes and Areas}

The configuration
space is an four dimensional prism with a four dimensional
cylinder subtracted.
The calculation can be carried out indirectly,
 using indicator functions for the
available space or for the prohibited space.

\subsection{Volume of available space}

We shall present the total four-dimensional volume as a product integral
of all available positions. To grasp the idea, a 
diagram is shown in the figure (\ref{diagintegra01}). Our
principal integral is the available free $4D$ volume, which 
we shall denote $V$:
\begin{multline}\label{volindic}
 V = \\ \int\limits_{x_1 = -a}^a \rd x_1 \int\limits_{x_2 = -a}^a \rd x_2 
\int\limits_{y_1 = -b}^b \rd y_1 \int\limits_{y_2 = -b}^b \rd y_2 \, \indicator{ (x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge (2r)^2 },
\end{multline}
where $\indicator{Z}$ indicates the indicator function of the set $Z$, 
given by $\mathbf{1}_Z (x) = 1$ if $x \in Z$, and $=0$ if $x \notin Z$, 
which restricts the integral to the desired region $Z$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{diagramintegra01.pdf}
  \end{center}
    \caption{The space to integrate is the product of the subspaces
      belonging to horizontal and vertical coordinates. The colour
      shaded area represents the ``exclusion'' set, where the condition 
      $ (x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge d^2 $ is not fulfilled. 
      Their width is dependent on the particular point of evaluation
      on the \emph{other} subspace. The diagonal coordinates
      make the expression to evaluate simpler. Due to 
      symmetry, we only evaluate the area in stripes and
      multiply the result by 16.}\label{diagintegra01}  
\end{figure}

We represent the excluded cylinder in the coordinates defined in 
the set of equation \ref{cambiocoor01}. 

\begin{multline}\label{integraltotal}
 V = \\ \int\limits_{x=-a \sqrt{2}}^{a \sqrt{2}} \rd x 
\int\limits_{X=-a \sqrt{2} + |x| }^{a \sqrt{2} - |x|}  \rd X
 \int\limits_{y=-b \sqrt{2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\int\limits_{Y=-b \sqrt{2} + |y| }^{b \sqrt{2}-|y|}  \rd Y
\, \indicator{ x^2 + y^2 \ge 2r^2  }.
\end{multline}
In these coordinates, $X$ and $Y$ do not appear in the integrating part, 
so that these integrals may be done trivially, 
thus reducing to the following two-dimensional integral:
\begin{multline}
 V  = \\ \int_{x=-a \sqrt{2}}^{a \sqrt{2}} \rd x  \int_{y=-b \sqrt{2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\, 2 \left( a \sqrt{2} - |x| \right) \, 2 \left( b \sqrt{2} - |y| \right) \,  \indicator{ x^2 + y^2 \ge 2r^2 } \\
 = 16 \int_{x=0}^{a \sqrt{2}} \rd x  \int_{y=0}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\, \left( a \sqrt{2} - x \right) \, \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right) \,  \indicator{ x^2 + y^2 \ge 2r^2 },
\end{multline}
using the symmetry.
Thus $V = 16(I_1 + I_2)$, where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the 
resulting integrals over the regions where the available region 
for $y$ is affected by, and is not affected by, respectively, 
the restriction to lie outside the disc.
We have
\begin{align}
 I_1 &= \int_{x=0}^{r\sqrt{2}} \left[ \int_{y = \sqrt{ 2r^2 - x^2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right) \rd y \right]  \left( a \sqrt{2} - x \right) \rd x \\
&= 	
2 a b^{2} r  + \textstyle \frac{1}{6} (a+b) (2r)^{3} - \frac{1}{32}  (2r)^{4} - \frac{1}{4} {\left(\pi a b + b^{2}\right)} (2r)^2,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
 I_2 &= \int_{x=r  \sqrt{2}}^{a \sqrt{2}} \left[ \int_{y = 0}^{b \sqrt{2}} \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right) \rd y \right]  \left( a \sqrt{2} - x \right) \rd x \\
&=	
{\left( a^{2} - 2ar +   r^{2}\right)} b^{2}.
\end{align}
Thus 
\begin{align}\label{volumeabd}
 V %= 16(I_1 + I_2) =     	
 & =  16 a^{2} b^{2}  - 16 \pi a b r^{2} + \textstyle \frac{64}{3} (a+b) r^{3}  - 8 r^{4} \\
&= V_\text{prism} - V_\text{cyl},
\end{align}
as was previously obtained by Munakata and Hu \cite{Munakata02}.

Note that the volume available to place two discs inside 
the hard box but \emph{without} the 
 hard-disc exclusion constraint is simply 
given by the first term, $V_\text{prism}=16 a^2 b^2$; 
thus, the remaining terms represent the excluded volume due to this constraint.
We shall call them $V_\text{cyl}=  16 \pi a b r^{2} - \textstyle \frac{64}{3} (a+b) r^{3}  + 8 r^{4}$.
This corresponds to the Volume of the exclussion cylinder (the overlapping conditions),
so we simply state that $V=V_\text{prism} - V_\text{cyl}$.

The available space gets smaller nevertheless, as can be seen from
the substitutions $a\rightarrow (w-d)/2$ and $b\rightarrow (h-d)/2$.
The explicit formula for the Volume as function from the diameter only is then:
\begin{multline}\label{volumewhd}
 V 
= (w-d)^{2} (h-d)^{2}  - \\ 
 \pi (w-d)(h-d) d^{2} + 
\textstyle \frac{4}{3} (w+h-2d) d^{3}  
- \frac{1}{2} d^{4},
\end{multline}
 
For the numeric values $w=h=1$, the biggest possible radius is 
$r=1/(2+\sqrt{2})$. Unhappily, there is a quirk in the above formula:
it stops being valid before that. The reason is that the deduction
of the formula doesn't include the case in which hopping is not possible. 
We tacitly made the assumption that $h,w>2d$.  This assumption is on 
the integration limits in the step in eq. \ref{integraltotal}. 
A full discussion of the formula for the case in which either
$w$ or $h$ are smaller than $4r$ but there is still space for
the disks is discussed in supplementary material \cite{notascalculokarel}). 
We cite the  result for $h/4  <r< w/4$ for illustrative purposes.
For cleanliness we define another auxiliary variable,
$c=\sqrt{4r^2-b^2}$:
\begin{multline}\label{VolumenCasoFeo}
V_{h/4<r} = 32abr^2[\arccos(b/2r)-\arccos(a/2r))]\\
+\frac{64 r^3}{3 }[a((b-a)/2r)-b(c/2r+\sqrt{4r^2-a^2}/2r)]\\
-8r^4 [ (b^2-a^2)/4r^2]\\ 
+16[ a b^2 c (4\sqrt{2}-1-\sqrt{2}/3)
+c^2b^2 (\sqrt{2}/3-1) \big]
\end{multline}
In the case that $r$ is larger than both $h/4, w/4$, one must take
into account a similar
contribution which inverts the roles of $a$ and $b$.

In all of our numeric examples we use $w=h=1$, setting the
limit for hops at $r=0.25$. %quite figura redundante del Volumen libre.
We have checked this result with simple Monte Carlo simulations, 
by generating random positions for the disks centres in 
$[-a,a] \times [-b,b]$ uniformly and 
counting the proportion of such initial conditions for 
which the two discs overlap. The fraction of these points to the 
total should give the fraction of prohibited volume over the hypercube
volume. The results are shown in the figure \ref{VolMonteC}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/VolCyl01.pdf}
\caption{Fraction of occupied volume by the excluded conditions
corresponding to the term $V_{cyl}$ in expression \ref{volumeabd}.
 The red continuous line represents the formula \ref{volumeabd} 
 fails after $ r>0.25$. The numerics
 are forced to follow the adequate behaviour, which is given
by a generalization of the expression \ref{VolumenCasoFeo}. 
 }\label{VolMonteC}
\end{figure}

The following subsections shall only show the formulas for $r<w/4, h/4$.
Bear in mind that some of the dynamics are possible above this limit,
it is only the position interchange that gets excluded. 

\subsection{Area of cross-section for horizontal interchange (hops), 
$\{x_1 = x_2\}$}\label{areahop}
The calculation of the $3$-dimensional area  ( all areas shall be 
denoted by $A$)
of the cross-section 
$\{x_1 = x_2\}$ becomes 
$\{ x=0 \}$ in the new coordinates, proceeds as follows:
First we concentrate the measure indicated on the eq. \ref{volindic}
multiplying a Dirac Delta $\delta(x)$ on the integrand:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
 A_\text{hopp} = \int_{x_1 = -a}^a \rd x_1 \int_{x_2 = -a}^a \rd x_2 
\int_{y_1 = -b}^b \rd y_1 \int_{y_2 = -b}^b \rd y_2 \, \indicator{ (x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge (2r)^2 } \delta(x).
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
Then we continue exactly as before:
\begin{align}
 A_\text{hopp} &= \int_{X=-a \sqrt{2} }^{a \sqrt{2}}  \rd X
 \int_{y=-b \sqrt{2}}^{b \sqrt{2}} \rd y
\int_{Y=-b \sqrt{2} + |y| }^{b \sqrt{2}-|y|}  \rd Y
\, \indicator{y^2 \ge 2r^2 } \\
&= 8 a \sqrt{2} \int_{y=0}^{b \sqrt{2}} 
\left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right)  \indicator{y \ge r \sqrt{2} }  \rd y \\
&= 8 a \sqrt{2} \int_{y= r\sqrt{2}}^{b \sqrt{2}}  \left( b \sqrt{2} - y \right)  \rd y \\
&= 8 \sqrt{2} a ( b - r )^2. \label{AreaH}
% b^{2} -  b d + \frac{d^{2}}{4} \right) .
\end{align}
As before, the formula stops being valid for $r>h/4$, but this time it has
no generalization, as hopping becomes impossible for these values. 

We have checked this result with simple Monte Carlo simulations, 
by counting the proportion of successful placements of hard discs 
for which the distance 
$|x_1 - x_2|$ is within a small tolerance of $0$. 
In this case, the possibility to fulfill
the hopping and the non overlapping conditions simultaneously exclude 
all the cases for $\sqrt{2}/(1+\sqrt{2}) <d<1/2$. 
Results are shown in figure \ref{AreaHopp01}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/AreHopPerfect01.pdf}
\caption{The hopping area, $A_\text{hopp}$, 
  indicated in the formula in eq. \ref{AreaH}. As explained
in the text, it gives nonsense for $r>1/4$, but numerical values stay
exactly at zero, the correct value. } 
\label{AreaHopp01}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Area of cross section for collisions}

The area which represents collisions between the two disks is the cylinder area. 
This can be deduced in a similar manner to the free volume, shown in the last
section, or as the derivative of this formula, taking it as as a function evaluated at 
$r\sqrt{2}$. The calculation must be done taking $a,b$ as constants, so that
we do not obtain also the (negative) contribution for the flat ends of
the wedge at the cylinder's end. The resulting area is:
\begin{align}\label{AreaChoque}
A_\text{collision} & =\sqrt{2}[  
16\pi a b r -32 (a+b)r^2 +16 r^3 ] 
\end{align}
Again, as in eq. \ref{volumewhd}, the formula stops being valid
at $r>0.25$, when the exclusion cylinder has a larger diameter than
the widths or heights of the prism.  
We proceed in the same manner as last section, checking numerically which
random
conditions fall at a small tolerance of $0$ from the Collision Condition, and
plotting this as a fraction of the total volume. The result is shown in the
figure \ref{AreaChoqueTeoyNum}. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/AreaCol01.pdf}
\caption{The numerical and theoretical calculation for the Area of the cross section
for collision between the disks.  The theoretical formula 
\ref{AreaChoque} breaks down at
$r>1/4$. 
An extra numerical point has been put there to show the deviating behaviour.}
\label{AreaChoqueTeoyNum}.
\end{figure}


\subsection{Area of cross section for  impacts on walls}

For comparison, we shall use also other area to compare
some properties of the decay of time distributions. The most natural choice
would be the mean time between any impact on the walls. This corresponds
to the adequate measure of the border of the four dimensional
billiard in which the dynamics takes place. This area is
the sum of the areas of the border of the
prism, taking into consideration the excluded tips of the cylinder. 
It shall be enough to calculate the cross section area for
the impact of one specific disk unto one specific wall and,
by means of the symmetry of the expressions, obtaining the whole
area. We proceed then to calculate the cross section corresponding to 
the disk $1$ hitting the right wall. We accomplish that by
evaluating the next expression in a similar way to
the procedure carried out in section \ref{areahop}:
\begin{equation}\label{areaindic}
 A_{x_1+} =  \int_{x_2 = -a}^a \rd x_2 
\int_{y_1 = -b}^b \rd y_1 \int_{y_2 = -b}^b \rd y_2 \, \indicator{ (a-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 \ge 4 r^2 }
\end{equation}
The integration procedure is equally tedious, but
straightforward, the result is 
\begin{align}\label{areax1p}
 A_{x_1+} & = 8 a b^2-4  \pi b r^2 +\frac{16}{3}r^3 
 % & = 2(w-d)^2 (h-2)^2- \frac{\pi}{2} (h-d) d^2 +\frac{2}{3}d^3 
\end{align}
Once again, a simple Monte Carlo procedure verifies this result,
shown in fig \ref{area1derecha}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/AreaPx1PositivaPerfec01.pdf}
\caption{The numerical and theoretical calculation for the cross section area
for the impact of a determined disk with the right wall, as in eq. \ref{areaindic}.
Again, the formula stops being valid at $r>1/4$. }
\label{area1derecha}.
\end{figure}

Given into account the symmetry of the expression for either of 
the disk bouncing in each of the vertical walls, the
cross section area for this event is four times $A_{x_1+}$. On
the other hand, each bounce against the horizontal walls would
define a similar quantity, but with the roles of $a$ and $b$ switched.
The cross section area for any impact on the walls would then be:
\begin{align}\label{areawalls}
 A_\text{walls} & = 32 a b (a+b)-16 \pi r^2 (a+b) +\frac{64\sqrt{2}}{3}r^3 
 %&=  4 (w-d) (h-d)  (w+h-2d) -2 \pi d^2 (w + h-2 d) +\frac{16}{3}d^3. 
\end{align}
The cross section area for any impact or collision 
is then  the sum of the last expression
and the area for collisions between disks, in eq. \ref{AreaChoque}.


\section{Mean times between events}

\subsection{Mean hopping time}

Inserting the results of the previous section 
into the formula for the mean times for crossing
surfaces of section, eq. \ref{meantimegeneral}, gives the times for 
horizontal hopping, 
collision between disks and impacts in general. For horizontal
hops we have:
\begin{equation}\label{hoptau}
 \mean{\tau}_\text{hopp} = 	
\frac{3 \pi}{2\sqrt{2}}
\frac{2 a^{2} b^{2}  - 2 \pi a b r^{2} + \textstyle \frac{a+b}{3}  (2r)^{3}  -  r^4}
{ a \sqrt{2}  ( b - r )^2}.
\end{equation}
The limiting form for very small disk is quite revealing: it is the time
to transverse the distance between two parallel lines at distance $w$ from
a random position, and is related to the Buffon's Needle distribution 
\cite{EScheinerman}:
\begin{equation}\label{hoptaulimit}
 \mean{\tau}_\text{hopp} \xrightarrow{r\sim 0} 	
\frac{3 \pi}{4}w.
\end{equation}
Also of interest is the limit $r\sim h/4$, where hoping becomes
impossible. The lower term goes to zero as $r^2$ become approximately constant.
This agrees with heuristic arguments. 
In the particular case $w=h$ as in our examples,
sting $r=h/4-\epsilon$ produces the limiting behaviour 
\begin{equation}
 \mean{\tau}_\text{hopp}(\epsilon) \xrightarrow{\epsilon\sim 0} 	
\frac{3 \pi}{8}
\frac{(1-\frac{2\pi+1}{32})}
{ \epsilon^2} w^3
\end{equation} 
This last expression coincides with  derivation by Bowles \etal \cite{Bowles04}, in
their equation 12,  which
predicts the same exponent for the behaviour of this hopping time. The figures
2 and 4 of the reference correspond to that regimen. 

\subsection{Mean collision time}

For the collisions between disk we would have:
\begin{equation}\label{colltau}
 \mean{\tau}_\text{coll} = 	
\frac{3 \pi}{2\sqrt{2}}
\frac {2 a^{2} b^{2}  - 2 \pi a b r^{2} + \textstyle \frac{a+b}{3}  (2r)^{3}  -  r^4}
{2\pi a b r -4(a+b)r^2+2r^3}
\end{equation}
As expected, this goes to infinity with very small radius, its behaviour
approaching the expression
\begin{equation}\label{colltaulim0}
\mean{\tau}_{coll}  \xrightarrow{r\sim 0} 
\frac{3}{8\sqrt{2}}\frac{wh}{r}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Mean impact time}

Lastly, for the general impact formula we have the expression:
\begin{equation}\label{impactwall}
 \mean{\tau}_\text{walls} = 	
\frac{3 \pi}{2\sqrt{2}}
\frac { 2a^{2} b^{2}  -  2\pi a b r^{2} + \frac{a+b}{3}(2r)^3 - r^4}
{ab[8(a+b)+2\pi r]- (4+2\pi)(a+b)r^2+\frac{22}{3} r^3},
\end{equation}
where we have abused from factorization to make the limits clear.

In the limit $r\rightarrow 0$ this goes to $3 \pi (hw)/(8\sqrt{2}(h+w))$.
This should correspond to the average impact time in the walls
for non interacting point particles, 
but, then, ergodic theory would not apply
on such a system. 


\section{Numeric Results}

\subsection{Mean times for events}

We proceed to test last section formulas with
extensive numerical simulations.
The next three figures, \ref{MeanHopp01}, \ref{MeanCol01}, and \ref{MeanImp01},  
we compare the
numerical and analytically curves for the mean times of different events.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{The mean hopping time as function of the radius, Energy, mass, 
and geometry fixed.

scales (inset).}\label{MeanHopp01}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/CollitionsErgodic02-ForPaper.pdf}
  \caption{The mean collision time as function of the radius. Same
    specifications as the last figure. }\label{MeanCol01}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/WallImpacts05-ForPaper.pdf}
  \caption{The mean impact-on-walls time as function of the radius. Again, same
    notes as the figure \ref{MeanHopp01}}\label{MeanImp01}.
\end{figure}

We check also some samples about the distribution of these times
in the next set of figures (\ref{histohopps}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.22\textwidth}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{HoppingTimesradio01.pdf}
                \caption{$d=0.1$}
                \label{smallradius}
        \end{subfigure}%
        ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad etc.
          %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.22\textwidth}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{HoppingTimesRadius249.pdf}
                \caption{$d=0.249$}
                \label{bigradius}
        \end{subfigure}       
        \caption{\pmb{I still have to repeat these graphics}.
Histograms for the mean hopping time

closed pass. While it is not customary to compare logarithmic and non
logarithmic scales, here I take that liberty for the funny features to be
more exaggeratedly shown.}\label{histohopps}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{bigradius} shows clearly an exponential decay in the
distribution, something to be expected for a chaotic system \cite{OttLibro}, 
while the
figure in \ref{smallradius} is something different. 

\section{Mean First Event Times}

Although we do not have a formula for the mean first event time as
we have for the mean return times, we can, with a slight modification
of our code, investigate the behaviour for these quantities. We have 
an interesting result: most \emph{first event times} deviate very slightly,
although systematically, from the \emph{mean return times}.
This could be explained as follows:
In an ergodic regimen we could simply average over a sufficiently large
sample of initial conditions instead of following each trajectory
and sampling events along it. This means that the mean return time
coincides with the mean first return time for large enough samples.
A \emph{mean first event time} could be though of a \emph{mean
first return time} with erroneous initial conditions, as if the
trajectories had started, so there would be an \emph{average offset}
for the times. As we show numerically, this is indeed the case. 


\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/FistHopTime01-ForPaper.pdf}
  \caption{The mean first time for the hopping event.
    We compare against the \emph{mean return time}, theoretical
and numerical. We observe how it is conterintuitivelly slightly longer,
but the qualitative behaviour is almost equal. }\label{FirstHopp01}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/FistCollTime02-ForPaper.pdf}
  \caption{The mean first collision time as function of the radius.
    Here we have  a slighter shorter time as the radius increases. The difference
is more notorious on the semi-log plot in the inset. 
 }\label{FirstCol01}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./FigurasPerfectas/FistImpactTime01-ForPaper.pdf}
  \caption{The mean first impact-on-walls time as function of the radius. Again, 
    we observe the same qualitative behaviour but now the whole range is below
    the mean return time. This is to be expected, as for any initial condition
    we would have a past condition on the wall. For very
    large radius the step away from the wall is almost negligible.}\label{FirstImp01}.

\section{Conclusions}


The Two Disks in a Box model has been extensively studied before, and
very interesting results have been obtained which could help
to derive reaction
and diffusion times from basic underlying phenomena.  Here
we show for first time exact analytic expressions for the mean event
times which lie behind this question. Most
significantly, we obtain formulas for the hopping and
collision mean times. The 
results which have helped us to do this came from the
extensive theory of chaotic billiards. The subjacent theory
of ergodic systems already contains strong theorems and formulas
that only need judiciously application to show their 
elucidating power. The step done by Machta and Zwanzig in
that direction is a clear example of grounding that
theory in applicable research. We have expanded
that line by showing that other phenomena can be modeled
as return times to appropriately chosen surfaces of section. 
In particular, the analytic formulas derived by these means
confirm the algebraic limiting behaviour obtained
by Bowle \etal by different path of reasoning. 
All numeric experiments support very nicely the results. 
A very reassuring fruition is that, even when we do not have
an exact expression for first event times, these follow
the general qualitative behaviour as the mean return times,
which give the latter a wider predictive power. The diffusive
or transport constants can now be obtained by adequate
interpretation of our results. 

The same technique can be further exploited for some other
qualities simply by solving the adequate measures
of volumes and areas. For Transport and Reaction problems
the results that we have shown here could be made to serve
the purpose of deriving the corresponding constants from first
principles.
